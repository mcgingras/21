# 21

practicing react/redux/PWA with a 21 app.
21 is a game the boys in the fisher house have been playing for weeks. It is a simple basketball game, but is great fun. I noticed that we were often pining for more detailed stats past just the simple wins and losses, so I got the idea to create a basic app and practice my PWA skills. This is the result.
